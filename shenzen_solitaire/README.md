# SHENZEN I/O Solitaire
I really liked that solitaire in [the game](http://store.steampowered.com/app/504210/) and decided to make a web-version.

## Assets
As program uses copyrighted assets, I've not included most of them here, and only modified ones included.
Modificated assets present in the repo:
1. `app_*` files.
2. `card_back_upgrade.png`
3. `stack_side_fix.png`
4. `favicons/*` folder.

List of not-included assets that bundled with the game and should be copied to this folder root:
1. Contents of `SHENZEN IO/Content/textures/solitaire`.
2. `card_deal.wav`, `card_pickup.wav`, `card_place.wav` and `card_sweep.wav` from `SHENZEN IO/Content/sounds`.
3. `Solitaire.ogg` from `SHENZEN IO/Content/music`.
4. `background.png` from `SHENZEN IO/Content/desktop`.

## Features
* Quite close clone of the in-game version.
* Sounds
* Music ambient
* Undo function unlocks when you Climb The Mountain. (Yes, yes, it wasn't present in original. But I did it anyway)
* Special card back unlocks when you Become Immortal.
### Planned features
* Improved and more authentic visuals
* Think out bonucs for Meeting the Dragon.
* Victory animation

## Know issues
* Z-index of cards sometimes not adjusted when dragging them.
* (kinda issue) Limited screen resolution support.
